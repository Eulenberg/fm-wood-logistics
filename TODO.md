# Support basic belts?
- Some mods can add basic transport belts (namely Bob's Logistics)... what to do then??

# Small iron electric pole technology?
- With AAI Industry, there's not much of a reason to use small (wood) electric poles outside of cost

# Fork Beautiful Bridge Railways
- They add wood to recipes without checking if already present
- (A) Move recipe change to data-final-fixes and add dependency
- (B) Fork beautiful bridge railways (I WOULD like to change a few things myself, like only adding steel bridge rails)

# Planned features:
- Wood belt sfx?
